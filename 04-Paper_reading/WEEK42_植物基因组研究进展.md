染色体规模的assembly正迅速成为高质量从头参考植物基因组的标准。结合纳米孔技术测序和optical map是实现这一目标的一种方法。

**植物基因组研究目的：**

 1. provides novel insights into important aspects of plant biology such as development, metabolism, evolution and adaptation
 2.  serve a wide community of plant biologists and bioinformaticians



**发展进程：**

**BAC：** bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) technique

 - gold standard for sequencing — the investments in labour and costs were huge
 
**NGS：**
 -  massive numbers of short reads of DNA can be generated quickly and at low cost.

Limitation：

 - difficult, in particular for larger and complex plant genomes
 - contiguity of genome assembly affected by  heterozygosity, repetitive sequences and duplicated regions.


**TGS:** third generation, sequencing that allows the generation of longer reads and thus higher quality
 - span entire repeat-containing regions, reconstruct haplotypes, resolve structural rearrangements
 - ead to chromosome-scale ‘reference’ genomes
 -  long-read sequencing alone will not (yet) do the job.
 
目前趋势：nanopore +optiocal map with organized into longer scaffolds

**Nanopore:** isolate high-molecular weight DNA is thus essential — and a couple million bases may be sequenced in a single continuous read

 - Compared to short-read assemblies of close relatives sequenced earlier, the long-read assembled contig N50s were between 100 and 450 times larger
 - greatly improved the completeness of the transposable element (TE) 
 -  S-locus, a region strongly enriched in TEs,now be completely reconstructed.
 -   centromeric regions (which are rich in repeats) and disease resistance genes, clusters of tandem-duplicated genes
 -   correct evolutionary history of genomes,  identification of duplicated regions is often tricky and relies on finding long stretches of similarity in gene order and conten.
 -   it has proven impossible to correctly assemble polyploid genomes with short read technologies, the sequencing of polyploids has been considered one of the last great challenges

**Pacbio:** long-read PacBio sequencing

**Hic:**chromosome conformation capture techniques
 
**Optical map:** ordered, genome-wide, high-resolution restriction maps from single, stained molecules of DNA
